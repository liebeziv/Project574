I discovered the SCSS directory when I was preparing to deploy a CSS solution 
Started researching SCSS for deployment and encountered some difficulties, such as an unsuccessful initial deployment 
Realised that I had to compile SCSS 
What started out as a very quick deployment and test consumed quite a bit of time due to the addition of SCSS

The new SCSS
html {
    height: 100%;
}

body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
    margin: 0;
}


main, 
.main-content,
.container-main {
    grid-row: 2;
    overflow-y: auto;
    min-height: 0;
}


footer,
.footer {
    grid-row: 3;
    position: static;
    margin-top: auto;
    background-color: $wger-light-2;
    border-top: 1px solid $wger-light-3;
}


@media (max-width: 576px) {
    body {
        grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
    }
    
    main, 
    .main-content {
        padding-bottom: 1rem;
    }
}



Restart Docker and import user data.
Challenge: When directly importing data using the `LOAD DATA` command, an `IntegrityError` occurred because the foreign key constraint (`gym_id`) in the data file did not exist in the database.

The solution was to manually import the dependent gym data file first, followed by the user data.

最终成功导入了包含 10 个用户的测试数据集，为验证 CSS 问题做好了准备。
使用了1920x1080 桌面尺寸 1440x900常用的笔记本尺寸
浏览器 Chrome Firefox Edge进行测试
目前条件下，我的部署方案可以适配，寻求pull request
